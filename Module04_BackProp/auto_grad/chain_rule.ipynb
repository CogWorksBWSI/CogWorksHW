    "## Basics of the Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "This module deals extensively with composite functions, e.g. $g(f(x))$ (or $(g \\circ f)(x)$, using specialized notation). This material introduces a simple method for computing derivatives of composite functions: the so-called chain rule. The chain rule can become unruly from a notational point of view, when using the familiar Liebniz notation for the derivate: $\\frac{df}{dx}$. For the moment, let's adopt a functional notation for the derivative: $f'(x)$. That is, $\\frac{df}{dx}$ and $f'(x)$ represent exactly the same function - the derivative of $f(x)$. Additionally, let's assume that all of our functions are only single-variable functions, for the time being.\n",

    "z(x) = (g \\circ f)(x)\\\\\n",

    "### Example Calculation Using the Chain Rule\n",
    "Let's jump to an example immediately to make sure that we are not confused by this notation. Consider the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(x) &= 3x + 1\\\\\n",
    "g(x) &= x^2 - 2\\\\\n",
    "z(x) = (g \\circ f)(x) &= (3x + 1)^2 - 2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are quite simple:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f'(x) &= 3\\\\\n",
    "g'(x) &= 2x\\\\\n",
    "z'(x) &= g'(f(x)) \\cdot f'(x)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the chain rule, this is all we need to compute the derivative of $z(x)$. Recognizing that $g'(f(x)) = 2f(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z'(x) = 2f(x) \\cdot  f'(x)\\\\\n",

    "\\\\\n",
    "z'(x) &= 18x + 6\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, write $z(x)$ out in full — as $z(x) = (3x + 1)^2 - 2$ — and take the its derivative directly (first simplify the squared term in the equation). Verify that the result you obtain agrees with the equation for $z'(x)$ that we arrived at by using the chain rule. Review this example carefully, and be sure to have a clear understanding of the symbolic form of the chain rule."

    "### Representing the Chain Rule Using Leibniz Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ultimately need to make use of the chain rule generalized to *multivariable* functions. For this, Leibniz notation is extremely valuable. Recall that we write the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$, with respect to $x$, as $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$. Return to the supplemental material in Machine Learning Module 2 for an overview of partial derivatives. Let's translate the chain rule into Leibniz notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "z'(x) &\\rightarrow \\frac{dz}{dx} \\\\ \n",
    "g'(f(x)) &\\rightarrow \\frac{dg}{df}\\Bigr|_{f=f(x)} \\\\\n",
    "f'(x) &\\rightarrow \\frac{df}{dx} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "$g$ is the only function that depends on another dependent variable - $f$. This is why we use the vertical line to indicate that the derivative of $g$ is to be evaluated using $f(x)$ as its input variable. Because we will always evaluate intermediate derivatives within the chain rule in this fashion, we can forego using the vertical line, and simply remain mindful of the preceding statement. Thus the chain rule, written using Leibniz notation, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{d(g \\circ f)}{dx} = \\frac{dg}{df}\\frac{df}{dx}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the notation that we will use moving forward, especially as we begin to work with partial derivatives of multi-variable functions. This simple chain rule is also sufficient for generalizing to an arbitratily-long sequence of compositions. See if you can use the former equation to prove that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d(f_1 \\circ f_2 \\circ ... \\circ f_n)}{dx} = \\frac{df_1}{df_2}\\frac{df_2}{df_3} ... \\frac{df_{n-1}}{df_n}\\frac{df_n}{dx}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\frac{df_j}{df_{j+1}}$ is understood to be evaluated at $f_{j+1} \\circ... \\circ f_n(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note to help clarify the vertical-bar notation used above. If you want to compute the derivative of $z$, evaluated at, say, $x = 2$, you would denote this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dx}\\Bigr|_{x=2} = \\frac{dg}{df}\\Bigr|_{f=f(2)} \\frac{df}{dx} \\Bigr|_{x=2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which, of course, is the same as writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z'(2) = g'(f(2)) \\cdot f'(2)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, $z'(2)$ and $\\frac{dz}{dx}\\Bigr|_{x=2}$ both mean: take the derivative of $z(x)$ and evaluate the resulting function at $x = 2$. It doesn't make sense to take the derivative of $z(2)$."

    "### Extending the Chain Rule for Multiple Variables\n",

Thus $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial f_1}\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}$ describes how varying $x$ affects $z$ **via** $f_1$.
